✨ Project Showcase: Global Happiness Analysis Dashboard ✨

This project aimed to investigate the relative impact of economic (GDP per Capita) vs. non-economic factors (Social Support, Health, Freedom, Generosity, Trust) on global Happiness Scores from 2015-2019, providing data-driven insights for policy-making.

My approach followed a standard data analysis lifecycle: starting with clearly #Ask ing the business question, #Prepare ing the raw data, rigorously #Process ing it for consistency, deeply #Analyze ing trends and correlations, and finally, #Share ing compelling visualizations to communicate insights.

Utilizing annual World Happiness Report data (2015-2019) in Excel for robust data processing and correlation analysis, the findings were then transformed into an interactive dashboard using Power BI Desktop.

Key Challenges & Solutions:
- Data Integration: Integrated disparate yearly datasets with varying structures by performing meticulous cleaning and standardization in Excel to create a unified, analysis-ready dataset.
- Visual Accuracy: Ensured Power BI visuals accurately represented numerical correlations by systematically troubleshooting data types and correctly placing fields on chart axes, validating aggregation and interpretation.
- Dashboard Design:Transformed raw visuals into a professional and aesthetically pleasing dashboard by leveraging Power BI's formatting tools, themes, and strategic layout principles for clarity and engagement.

Key Insights from the Analysis:
- Identified that 'Economy (GDP per Capita)' and 'Health (Life Expectancy)' consistently show the strongest positive correlations with Happiness Score, highlighting their significant impact.
- Developed interactive scatter plots to visually demonstrate these strong linear relationships across countries, complemented by a bar chart comparing the relative influence of all analyzed factors.
- Confirmed overall stability in global average happiness and economic factors over the analyzed period, providing a solid baseline for further exploration.

This dashboard provides clear, data-driven insights into the primary drivers of happiness, offering valuable intelligence for stakeholders focused on improving global well-being and informing strategic initiatives.
